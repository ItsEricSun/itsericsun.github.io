I'm a third-year student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science who is interested in software development. 

Currently I'm working at [TensorDock](https://tensordock.com) which is a platform for deploying cheap cloud servers.

I love to take photos, go biking, rock climbing, video games, eating food, and drinking boba.
