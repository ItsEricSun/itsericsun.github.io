I'm a third-year student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science who is interested in software development. 

I'll be interning at [EnergySage](https://www.energysage.com/) in the Spring and [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) in the Summer as a Software Engineer.

I love to take photos, go biking, rock climbing, skateboarding, traveling, video games, and eating food.
