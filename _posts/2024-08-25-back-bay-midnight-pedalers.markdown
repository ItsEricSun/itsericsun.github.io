This will be my first blog type post :D

The Back Bay Midnight Pedalers is an annual event that started in 1989. It's a 30 mile ride that usually occurs on a weekend in August starting at midnight and going till sunrise. The ride passes by historic and architectural landmarks in the Boston area. At each stop, the leaders of the bike ride share the history of the site and fun facts. Anyone can join by just showing up at the start of the ride, usually at Trinity Church in Copley Square, or this year at the front steps of the Boston Public Library due to construction near the Church. This year, the ride started with around 100 riders and finished with 40.

A friend shared this link with me [https://www.mit.edu/~jweiss/BBMP/](https://www.mit.edu/~jweiss/BBMP/) and I decided to try it out this summer! It was so fun, I would recommend it to anyone who likes biking and learning about the history of Boston. I'm looking forward to next year's ride!

This will be a collection of videos and pictures from the ride :)
